Improving my productivity is long trip. I'm practising GTD 10 months now. As a todo list software, I moved from Omnifocus to Todoist mainly to be able to access to my lists on every device.

My question today : which name for a project? I think the projet name must be a goal, the aim, the objective of this project. Not a vague Idea.

Example :

Instead of "English", "Learning english" or better "Be prepared for TOEFL exam".
For pratical reason, it must not overly long.
