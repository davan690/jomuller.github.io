This is my first post with Jekyll. I'm not sure I will use this blogging system a long time but I want to give a try.

My previous blog engine blog was Wordpress but I wanted something more minimalist... and cheaper. Furthermore, I'm now confortable with the usage of _Vim_, _Markdown_ and _Git_. Then I'm the perfect target audience for Jekyll!

This post is just a test then don't read it!

Just a test with some R code

```r
library(vartors)

for (one in may) {
    do_something
}

summary(x = a)
```

That's all for today!
