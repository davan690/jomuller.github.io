As a Mac OS user, i'm very happy to use the _Preview_ sofware to read and annotate my PDFs. I read a lot of PDF beacause I'm in an academic field. _Preview_ does exactly what I need: Highlight following the lines and keeping the text clear (not just an alpha layer), comments, add figures. Maybe I would be perfect if I could directly drawn on my PDFs with my graphical tablet. Furthermost, when I'm editing a PDFs with _Preview_, I don't have to save it on another format. But _Preview_ have a major drawback: it's not open source and don't exist on Linux.

I'm trying to switch to linux then I need to find something close to _Preview_. Here the list of sofwares I tested and their results.

After a small reasearch with duckduckgo, I found a list on the site of [pdfreaders.org](http://pdfreaders.org/pdfreaders.en.html). the candidates are the following

# Acrobat Reader

Acrobat Reader is the default choice to read PDF. It's a propriatery software but in his last (Adobe Acrobat Reader DC) version on MacOS and Windows, he does the job pretty well. But there is no Linux Version of this software.

# Okular

[Okular](https://okular.kde.org/) seems to be a good candidate.

Highlith work perfectly, I could save my annotation in the PDF.

The only thing a little bit annoying is that one have to do save as to save the annotation. Can't use compulsivly ctrl-s. (by boss hate when I'm doing that).

# Evince

[Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince) is just a PDF viewer, then it doesn't do the job.

# xournal

Very nice but use his own format

# Conclusion

Okular is the way to go!:w
