Currently I'm working in a infection control department in an french teaching hospital. This field is without doubt my favorite because it's close to the patients, it implies a broad range of knowledges (infectious diseases, epidemiology, risk management, microbiology, data management...) and, I think, data science may help a lot this discipline.

I was really excited when I saw that's one of the major paper in hospital infection control dedicated his last issue about computer and data science!

<img src="/assets/ajic_cover.git" title="Cover of AJIC"  style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The [American Journal of Infection Control](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/ajic-american-journal-of-infection-control/) is the official publication of the [Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology](http://apic.org/). It have an 5 year impact factor of 2.5 in 2015. That's not huge but quite good in this field.

In this issue, I have selected some article I plan to read carrefully :

- *APIC advocacy on health information technology*
- *Clinical decision support systems and infection prevention: To know is not enough*
- *Slow adoption of automated infection prevention surveillance: Are human factors contributing?*
- *Automated tracking and ordering of precautions for multidrug-resistant organisms*: I already read it. I dream to have the same system in my healcare facility!
- *Data elements and validation methods used for electronic surveillance of health care-associated infections: A systematic review*
- *Hospital infection control units: Staffing, costs, and priorities*
- *A computer-based automated reminder increases the percentage of urinary catheters justified by an order and increases urinary catheter discontinuation orders*
