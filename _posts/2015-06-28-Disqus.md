If someone is reading this blog, you will be happy to know that it's now possible to make comments! I had [an issue](https://github.com/jomuller/jomuller.github.io/issues/1) from one (maybe the only one) reader of this blog about this. 

I decided to use [Disqus](https://disqus.com) because it is the easiest solution for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The installation was painless, in only 5 min!

I tried firt to install [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) on my own VPS but after 45 min I gave up. The idea was to control all my information. But Disqus is so simple that I succumbed to it.

Then, don't hesitate to send me some comments!
