I decided to five a try to [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/), a fork of Vim, for several reasons:

- First because my of my favourite Vim plug-in, [Vim-R-plugin](https://github.com/jcfaria/Vim-R-plugin) changed to [Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R). I really love this plug-in, use it on a daily basis and I trust the choices of his creator. It was the main motivation
- Then because I like to use cutting-edge tools
- And finally because one of my collegue and friend start to use it.

As we can see, the motivations to change a tool are not mainly objective. There is no technical reasons. My core motivation come from choices made by people I trust.

NeoVim is steel young, have some issues on install time but I'm happy of my choice for the moment.
