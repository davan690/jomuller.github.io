Quicklook is a very nice function in OSX: just press the space bar and you have a preview of the selected file. However, it only work for a limited types of files.

Today, I discovered [QuickLookR](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/QuickLookR). After a very quick install (copy one file in a folder and install an R package), it work perfectly.

It show gently a summary of the data. Very helpful!
