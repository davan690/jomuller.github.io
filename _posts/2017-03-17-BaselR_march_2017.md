Last week I took part in the [BaselR meeting](http://www.baselr.org) hosted in the very nice Roche Learning Center Auditorium and organised by [Mango-Solutions](http://www.mango-solutions.com/wp/). 
I find these informal meetings mostly organised via meetup perfectly fit the nature of what data science seems to be currently: it's organic, there is still not defined frame, things are moving very fast and people have to meet.

There were three talks summarised below.

## FFTrees

[FFTrees](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees) was [presented](https://ndphillips.github.io/BaselR/#1) by its creator, [Nathaniel D. Phillips](Nathaniel D. Phillips). This package aims to create fast and frugal decision trees. That's fit perfectly in my needs: be pragmatic with statistics. Furthermore the visualisation produced is very informative. I already have some ideas for implementations in my field.

## Reproducible analysis

I presented [a pragmatic reproducible analysis workflow with R](http://www.baselr.org/presentations/2017/03/BaselR_-_Reproducible_analysis_-_Joris_Muller_-_20170307.pdf). If you are following my blog, you know that's a [topic I'm working on]({% post_url 2017-01-19-reproducible_analysis_my_principles %}). That's why I gave another talk on this subject, showing how I extended my workflow with some solution to archive a part of software layer thanks to packrat (more about this in a later post on this blog).

## R with Python

[Rita Giordano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritagiordano/) talked about [*Structural biology with R*](http://www.baselr.org/presentations/2017/03/BaselR_-_Structural_Biology_with_R_-_Rita_Giordano_-_20170307.pdf). I had a strong interest in the way she shows us how to use R with Python with [Rpy2](https://rpy2.bitbucket.io/). The point was not the traditional R VS Python debate but instead how diversity of these programming languages can lead to powerful data analysis. By the way, in our [next R user group in Strasbourg](http://www.baselr.org/presentations/2017/03/BaselR_-_Structural_Biology_with_R_-_Rita_Giordano_-_20170307.pdf) we will be talking about R vs Python!
